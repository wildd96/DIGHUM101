This dataset compares topics and word frequency in Finland's 'Firearms Act of 1998' and the United States 'Gun Control Act of 1968'. I clean the data and tokenize the lammetized words. I create visuals which include word clouds and bar graphs. I then create a topic model and find common themes within these Acts to draw conclusions about how the government treats firearm policy. I was able to draw the conclusion that between these two texts, one had a focus on the criminal aspect while the other had a more transactional focus.
